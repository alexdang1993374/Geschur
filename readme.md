# Geschur
<img  src="./img/ges.JPG" alt="demo">

This app uses machine learning to read what gestures users are making on their cameras and overlays images ontop of their video feed. Users can also upload their own images for the gestures.

Geschur was made using Teachable Machine, ml5.js, and p5.js.

Go to geschur.herokuapp.com to see Geschur in action!

## To start the app:

### Run

### `npm install -g live-server`

### Then run 

### `live-server`

Open localhost:8080 to open the app in the browser.
